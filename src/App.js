/* 
Outline
- Take HTML from Toy Tales lab and turn it into JSX
  - https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-1-challenge-toy-tale/blob/master/index.html
  - What needs to change? What's the same?
- Refactor HTML into separate components
- JSX Syntax
- Pass in props

Exercise
- create a ToyCard component
- start by hard-coding the JSX in your component return statement
- then use props to make your component reusable
- you can copy/paste data from the toys.js file as props
- as a bonus, try importing data from the toys.js file
